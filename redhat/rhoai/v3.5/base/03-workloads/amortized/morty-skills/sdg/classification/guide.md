# Classification — SDG Guide

Use this guide when building ticket classifiers, intent routers, sentiment
analyzers, or content moderators.

## How This Works

You will gather requirements and call `validate_sdg_job` with the
appropriate parameters. The classification pipeline generates labeled
examples where each sample has input text and a classification label.

There is no classification template yet — use the knowledge-ingestion
starter template as a structural reference for how columns,
model_configs, and processors are organized.

## Requirement Gathering

Ask the user these questions (one at a time, with numbered options):

1. **What domain?** — What kind of content will this classifier handle?
   e.g., customer support tickets, user messages, content moderation.
2. **What categories?** — What labels should the classifier predict?
   Suggest 3-6 relevant labels based on the domain. Let the user
   customize or define their own.
3. **Urgency levels?** — Should the classifier also assign urgency?
   1) Yes, 3 levels — Low, Medium, High
   2) Yes, 4 levels — Low, Medium, High, Critical
   3) No urgency — Just classify by category
4. **Which teacher model?** — Call `list_models` to get the models
   configured on the AI Gateway. Present ONLY those models as options.
   Do NOT suggest models that aren't returned by `list_models` — they
   won't work. If no models are returned, stop and direct the user to
   Settings → AI Gateway.
5. **How many samples?** — Scale based on category count and desired
   coverage. Recommend at least 50 samples per category for basic
   coverage and 150+ per category for production quality.
   1) N×50 samples — Basic coverage across all categories
   2) N×100 samples — Good diversity, recommended
   3) N×150 samples — Best quality, most diverse examples
   (where N = number of categories × urgency levels)
6. **Distribution** — Should categories be balanced or weighted?
   Default: roughly balanced unless the real-world distribution is known.

## Tool Parameters

Call `validate_sdg_job` with these parameters. Customize columns,
prompts, and categories based on the user's specific task. Use the
model name from `list_models` in `model_configs`.

Key parameters for classification:
- `columns` — a category sampler, an LLM column to generate text, an LLM column to generate labels
- `model_configs` — `[{"alias": "text", "model": "<from list_models>", "provider": "gateway", "skip_health_check": true}]`
- `processors` — schema_transform to produce SFT `messages` format
- `num_records` — based on category count (see sample count step)

Call `present_options` with step="sdg-domain" and these options:
- title: "Software/technical support", description: "Bug reports, feature requests, troubleshooting", value: "Software/technical support — Bug reports, feature requests, troubleshooting"
- title: "Billing & payments", description: "Invoices, refunds, subscription issues", value: "Billing & payments — Invoices, refunds, subscription issues"
- title: "Customer service", description: "Account access, onboarding, general inquiries", value: "Customer service — Account access, onboarding, general inquiries"
- title: "E-commerce", description: "Orders, shipping, returns, product questions", value: "E-commerce — Orders, shipping, returns, product questions"

STOP here. Do NOT continue to step 2 in this message.

### Step 2 — Categories (ask AFTER user picks domain)

Based on the domain they chose, suggest specific category labels:

"What categories should it classify into?"

For customer support, call `present_options` with step="sdg-categories" and these options:
- title: "Standard categories", description: "Billing, Technical, Account, General Inquiry", value: "Standard categories — Billing, Technical, Account, General Inquiry"
- title: "Detailed categories", description: "Billing, Technical, Account, Shipping, Returns, Product Questions", value: "Detailed categories — Billing, Technical, Account, Shipping, Returns, Product Questions"
- title: "Custom categories", description: "I'll define my own labels", value: "Custom categories — I'll define my own labels"

For other domains, suggest 3-4 relevant groupings.

STOP here. Do NOT continue to step 3 in this message.

### Step 3 — Urgency levels

"Should the classifier also assign an urgency level?"

Call `present_options` with step="sdg-urgency" and these options:
- title: "Yes, 3 levels", description: "Low, Medium, High", value: "Yes, 3 levels — Low, Medium, High"
- title: "Yes, 4 levels", description: "Low, Medium, High, Critical", value: "Yes, 4 levels — Low, Medium, High, Critical"
- title: "No urgency", description: "Just classify by category", value: "No urgency — Just classify by category"

### Step 4 — Sample count

"How many training examples should we generate?"

Call `present_options` with step="sdg-samples" and these options:
- title: "100 samples", description: "Quick prototype", value: "100 samples — Quick prototype"
- title: "500 samples", description: "Good coverage across categories", value: "500 samples — Good coverage across categories"
- title: "1000 samples", description: "Best model quality, more diverse examples", value: "1000 samples — Best model quality, more diverse examples"

### Step 5 — Teacher model

Call `list_models` to discover available models from the AI Gateway.
Call `present_options` with step="sdg-teacher-model" and each model as an option.
ALWAYS add as the last option:
- title: "Configure a model", description: "Set up an AI Gateway endpoint in Settings", value: "Configure a model — Set up an AI Gateway endpoint in Settings"

## After SDG — Training

Recommend OSFT training. Read `skills/training/knowledge-ingestion/osft/guide.md`
for the training config. Chain via `parent_job_id`.
